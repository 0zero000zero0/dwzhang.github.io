Dingwen Zhang (张丁文) is a junior undergraduate at Guizhou University. I’m honored to have been mentored during my studies by Qi Wang (王崎) and Panfeng Chen (陈攀峰), working on knowledge graphs, graph neural networks, and large language models.

My research interests include knowledge graphs, graph neural networks, and their applications in the legal and agricultural fields.

# 📝 Projects

### **Research on Knowledge Graph Construction and Link Prediction for Global Pesticide Repurposing Discovery**

  * **负责人 (Project Lead)**, 2024.06 – 2025.06
  * Crawled pesticide registration data from major agricultural countries and institutions, cleaned the data, and constructed a global pesticide knowledge graph using Neo4j.
  * Trained knowledge graph embedding models (TransE) for link prediction, achieving a Hit@10 of 0.54 and 0.31 in different settings.
  * The pre-trained model is used to predict new targets for existing pesticides, providing a scientific basis for pesticide repurposing experiments.
  * **Project Link**: [pesticide-repurposing.samlab.cn](http://pesticide-repurposing.samlab.cn/)

### **Interpretable Judicial Judgment Prediction Method Based on Legal Article Constraints and Case Fusion**

  * **负责人 (Project Lead)**, 2025.03 – 2025.06
  * This project addresses the issues of "hallucination" and insufficient legal knowledge in large language models for judicial judgment prediction.
  * We propose a method that incorporates external legal knowledge to guide the LLM in extracting key facts from cases.
  * The method utilizes Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) from a database of legal articles and historical cases to improve the accuracy and interpretability of predictions.
